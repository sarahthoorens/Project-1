# Project 1 for bootcamp
Collaborative front-end project to build a web application that helps with a need in the world.



# Mood Movie
Created movie information search page.  Used to search for movie information and fun things related to them and bring them all together on one page.  Gifs realted to the movie/theme, youtube videos that could give reviews or larger clips than gifs, and the informaiton related tot he movie such as title, description, etc. 



## Mood Movie Description
When the page loads you will be presented with a header letting you know the title of the page.  A search box will be center page with a recent search list nested below it.  When you click on the search and type in a movie or series such as 'Avengers' you will be taken to a new page with up to six titles.  Each of the six will give the movies name when scrolling over the image of their movie poster.  When you click on the movie poster/image a modal will pop out with several links and information.  

You will see the movie poster again on the left along with general information on the movie, below that you will see a gif carosel that lists up to five gifs related to the movie/series/franchise that you can scroll through.  To the right (or below depending on screen size) you will see up to three youtube links for top youtube videos related to the searched movie.  Clicking on the youtube link will take you to the youtube video in question.
